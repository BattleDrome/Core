<H2>BattleDrome Documentation</H2>
<p>Eventually full end-user documentation for the project will live here. But for the alpha, as we revise, a wiki is far better suited to this task.</p>
<p>So for the alpha and beta phases, please see the github wiki at: <a href="https://github.com/BattleDrome/Core/wiki">BattleDrome Core Wiki</a></p>
<p>Also we strongly encourage the user-base to contribute and add to that wiki.</p>
